I ran into [Using LLMs and Cursor to become a finisher](https://zohaib.me/using-llms-and-cursor-for-finishing-projects-productivity/) the other day (this one should have a via link, but now I don't remember where I saw it). I made a kind of resolution this fall to start building more stuff, well before I read this, but Zohaib has a good reminder. Software Engineers are builders by nature, but we frequently end up in roles that aren't really about building: either you get into management or management-adjacent roles, or your day-to-day is maintenance, bug fixes, and operations. That's a problem career-wise, but really it's not good for the soul. If you're in software, you're probably a builder, and those kind of roles destroy you from the inside. 

> Because my time has always been limited, progress on side projects had been slow in the past, and many remained unfinished as life's events caused a loss of momentum, making them harder to resume. 

That's always been a massive problem for me - writing the code is the easy part, but the hassle around finishing has always been the problem. Luckily, it's easier than ever. I've been consistently surprised and delighted at how I can overcome obstacles building on the knowledge that's out there. There's a million problems out there that are not addressed in a way I'd like (or are covered in ads and popups asking you to enable notifications, subscribe to a newsletter, etc). Every little irritation in daily life is a call to your inner builder to build something.

I like Zohaib's prompting method. When I started [my utilities site](https://www.meggie.be), I was the micro-managing Product Owner. Claude interestingly managed me back. I gave it a list of a half-dozen little utilities that I wanted to make, and Claude implemented only one of them, with a framework for expansion that was easy for me to grok. Zohaib seems to be working as more of a conversation, and I think that works better. About six months ago, I was talking to someone about prompting and he gave me a kind of long-winded exposition. I summarized his point as "don't micromanage the LLM" and he said "Yeah! That's exactly it!". It's simple advice but it's hard for me to resist the urge to barf out a fully-realized product spec and have a conversation instead. Working with humans and LLMs present some of the same challenges.

Zohaib also has some great tips on using Cursor effectively, some of these I didn't know and others are just good habits that I needed to be reminded of. 

Have a good day. I'm off to go build something.
