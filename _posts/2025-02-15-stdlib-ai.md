<a href="https://ghuntley.com/stdlib/">Geoffrey Huntley</a> advocates for building a `stdlib` for Cursor. I learned about `.cursorrules`, that alone was worth reading. He calls it a standard library, that's an OK metaphor, but by the end I was thinking that this is improving your memory for how to be a better software developer. I learn new practices all the time, but actually remembering to use them is something else. Even across a codebase I wrote myself, I see my consistency wavering, and I can see myself learning and then forgetting. What he describes is building a machine that helps you build software consistently. I've noticed Claude's tendency to push tools I don't use or change code that I've written, and then I'm treating the AI like a junior coder who made an ill-advised PR. So one task for this weekend is to figure out `.cursorrules`.
