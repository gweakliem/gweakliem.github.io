Should have a RSS feed thanks to [Dzhavat Ushev](https://dzhavat.github.io/2020/01/19/adding-an-rss-feed-to-github-pages.html). It surprised me that Github pages doesn't ship with one out of the box considering that blogging is one of the primary use cases.

I wrote a little script to generate new posts: [post.sh](https://github.com/gweakliem/gweakliem.github.io/blob/main/post.sh). I was writing my first post thinking "I'm going to screw this up real soon" which is the signal that I should write a script to automate it. The next signal is that the script is already got annoying bugs that I could probably fix by applying `sed` or something dumb, but I should just rewrite it in Python.

TODOs:
* [Self-updating Github Profile](https://simonwillison.net/2020/Jul/10/self-updating-profile-readme/)
* Linkblog. [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/22/link-blog/) talks about his rationale, and [John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/02/willisons-approach-to-running-a-link-blog) gave his own take. I think for my purposes, I could just create a separate category.
* I like Simon's TILs too. I could also do those as a category. For example, TIL that you can use `uv` to [build a single-file Python script that requires external depnedencies](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/19/one-shot-python-tools/)
