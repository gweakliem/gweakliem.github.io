[Twitterlike is a Bad Shape](https://osteophage.neocities.org/essays/twitterlike) got me thinking about the meta of social media. Twitter and its clones have become infamous for toxic communications: character limits, anti-linking culture where the headline becomes the TL;DR, repost shares, algorithmic feeds and the A-listing that comes with it, lack of context, etc. It's pretty well accepted that Twitter was a shitshow before the takeover and Mastodon and Bluesky are trying to avoid that but making many of the same mistakes.

LinkedIn has toxic positivity: everyone is boosting everyone else, no matter how vapid the take. So the incentive is to post vapid takes, inviting "controversy" by claiming that something patently non-controversial is "unpopular opinion". In this case the algorithmic feed encourages frequent posting, and nobody has too many groundbreaking things to say on a daily basis, but we're cargo-culting networking here. People don't really call out stupid posts or stupid comments - you'll get a dumb comment that shows they didn't read the entire article and the poster will patiently explain what was already in the article. There's also the hashtag culture, sprinkle all kinds of hashtags on your post as if people actually follow #worklifebalance... no wait, those people actually exist.
